    <h1 id="why-notes">Why Notes?</h1>

<p>Why did I add the notes section?</p>

<p>Often I feel like I don't have enough time to put into writing a full-on blog post. But I still want to share little tid-bits that I find interesting. Whether or not they may be useful to wider public.</p>

<p>This is also a way of attempting to lower the barrier to posting content on this site. I'd like to be able to write notes about things I find useful and have a rolling documentation I can use in the future personally. If other people find these useful that would be cool too but is not the main goal.</p>

<p>Notes are intended to be short raw snippets and may not make 100% sense or be 100% fact checked. :) You'll be getting my raw thoughts and experiences, which are bound to evolve and change.</p>
