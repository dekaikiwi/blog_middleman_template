# Why Notes?

Why did I add the notes section?

Often I feel like I don't have enough time to put into writing a full-on blog post. But I still want to share little tid-bits that I find interesting. Whether or not they may be useful to wider public.

This is also a way of attempting to lower the barrier to posting content on this site. I'd like to be able to write notes about things I find useful and have a rolling documentation I can use in the future personally. If other people find these useful that would be cool too but is not the main goal.

Notes are intended to be short raw snippets and may not make 100% sense or be 100% fact checked. :) You'll be getting my raw thoughts and experiences, which are bound to evolve and change.
